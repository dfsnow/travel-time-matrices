### `01_generate_buffer_files.R`

Script to generate the GeoJSON buffer files saved in `../buffers/`. State boundaries are sourced from the 500k resolution TIGER/Line files (via the [tigris R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/index.html)). Does not need to be run, only included for reproducibility.
