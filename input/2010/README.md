# 2010 Routing Resources

This directory contains pre-calculated origins and destinations for routing between 2010 Census geographies. Two geographies are included, census tracts and [ZCTAs](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html). Origins and destinations **are population-weighted centroids of their respective geographies** (based on 2010 census block populations).
